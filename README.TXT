PANSPERMIA README

Panspermia is a game about exploring the properties of seeds you plant and exploiting their effects. It is a 2D platformer and you can move the character with the left and right arrow keys, jump with the up arrow, and use a limited flight ability with spacebar. You regain energy for flight by defeating enemies.

You start on one floating block. Donâ€™t fall! Select seeds from your inventory at the bottom of the screen by clicking on them with the mouse. You start with one default seed that will grow a platform. You can break blocks with left click. Right click to destroy blocks. Harvest fruit blocks by breaking them. You can gain back seeds from a platform by harvesting the fruit. You get entirely new randomized property fruit by harvesting mutant fruit. These fruits will grow in different ways and produce different blocks. To combine properties of the helpful fruits you find, you can crossbreed them by dragging a fruit in your inventory onto another fruit; this will combine the fruits and produce a new seed with merged effects.

There are regular blocks, turrets that fire at enemies, fertile soil that boosts seeds, spikes, enemy spawners, bouncy platforms, mud, oxygen blocks, vines, fruit, and mutant fruit blocks. These can all grow from the seeds you plant. Be careful of enemies and use the turrets to your advantage.

You win the game by climbing to a certain height.
